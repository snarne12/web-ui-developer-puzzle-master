# 1. Code Complexity & Readability

TypeScript Configuration Files:
The tsconfig.json, tsconfig.lib.json, and tsconfig.spec.json files are well-structured, but having too many configurations might indicate that the project setup could be complex. Consider simplifying these configurations if possible, or providing documentation on why each setting is needed.

# 2. Performance & Build Issues

Angular Compiler Options:
In tsconfig.lib.json, options like skipTemplateCodegen and enableResourceInlining are performance optimizations. These settings can lead to faster builds but might introduce issues if your templates or inlined resources become large or complex.


# Migrate from TSLint to ESLint

**Why:** TSLint has been deprecated, and ESLint is now the recommended linter for TypeScript projects. Migrating to ESLint would provide you with a more robust and actively maintained linter.

**How:** Use tools like typescript-eslint to configure ESLint for your project. There are guides and automatic migration tools to help with this transition.


# Accessibility issuess
*** Buttons do not have an accessible name ***

When a button doesn't have an accessible name, screen readers announce it as "button", making it unusable for users who rely on screen readers. Learn how to make buttons more accessible.

These are opportunities to improve the semantics of the controls in your application. This may enhance the experience for users of assistive technology, like a screen reader.

*** Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio. ***
Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read. Learn how to provide sufficient color contrast.
